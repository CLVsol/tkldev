Overview
--------

With TKLDev, building an appliance from scratch is as easy as grabbing
the source and running make::

    root@tkldev ~$ cd core
    /turnkey/fab/products/turnkey/core
    root@tkldev turnkey/core$ make

If you can handle that you're ready to roll.

Although TKLDev is relatively easy to use, it'll probably save you some
time if you read through the documentation first to get an overview of
how things works, development best practices, etc.

Hopefully, we've made this stuff easy enough to use so nearly anyone
with the inclination can jump in and make cool stuff happen. All the
hard, really technical bits are automated so you don't need a lot of
Linux experience to work with tkldev. The same amount of experience
you'd need to install and configure a regular Debian installation will
take you a long way. The difference being that you can mass reproduce
the results and collaborate with others on the development in ways you
couldn't do otherwise.
