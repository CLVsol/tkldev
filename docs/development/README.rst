Development
===========

Before getting started with development, you should have already
followed the `Setup`_ guide, resulting in a successful build of `TurnKey
Core`_. Following along the `Hello world`_ examples should also be
helpful.

After that you're ready to dive in:

* `Understanding the build process / terminology <buildprocess.rst>`_
* `Walking through example source code <walkthrough.rst>`_
* `Improving and maintaining an integration <maintenance.rst>`_
* `Developing a new integration <new.rst>`_

Notes on how we use Git:

* `Git Configuration and Workflow`_
