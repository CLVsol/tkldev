Development
===========

Before getting started with development, you should have already
followed the `Installation`_ and `Setup`_ guides, resulting in a
successful build of `TurnKey Core`_.

After that you're ready to dive in:

* `System image build process and terminology`_
* `Source code walkthrough`_
* `Improving and maintaining an integration`_
* `Developing a new integration`_

Notes on how we use Git:

* `Git Configuration and Workflow`_
